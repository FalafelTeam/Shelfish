# Shelfish
For our project, we decided to use:
 - Java
 - Maven
 - Spring Framework
      ° introduces MVC project structure which is easy to understand, as well as brings great capabilities to the project.
 - MySQL
    ° for the database
 - Hibernate
	  ˚ for managing database from inside the program
 - HTML
 - GitHub

Our application is a web application. Our idea is that the system is going to be used by both users and librarians. A user goes to the website, searches for a document he wants, then books it. After that, he physically goes to the library, says that he has a booking, librarian then hands out the document to a user and changes the order status to “taken”. During the 2/3/4 weeks from taking the document, user can watch the time remaining on the website. If user brings the document back before the time has expired, he is free to go (and librarian deletes the order) or he can renew the document (and librarian changes order status to “renewed”); if his document is overdue, he is forced to pay a fine.
